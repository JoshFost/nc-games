# My Front-end Project

This project is a front-end web application that allows users to view reviews about some classic games, as a user you can view individual reviews and the comments left on them and even post comments yourself. In addition the user can also vote on each review. Using the navigation, reviews can also be filtered by a specific category. You can access the deployed version of the app at https://house-of-gamez.netlify.app/.

# How to use the app

You can navigate yourself to categories using the nav, which will render a list of all the game categories. each category can be seleted to reveal all the game reviews for said category.
